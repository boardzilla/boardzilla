single giant procedure, can freeze history and rseed and replay state if lost connection

play: {
  do {
    // deal

    do {
      await anyPlayerPlay(passCard)
    } while (find('passed card').count < 12)

    // pass cards

    setCurrentPlayer(find('#2C').owner())
    await repeat(13, async {
      this.delete('led')
      await playersInTurn(turn => async {
        await card = currentPlayerPlay(playCard)
        if (turn === 0) this.set('led', card.suit)
      })
      // score trick      
    })
    // score hand
  } while (max(score) < 100)
}

playCard: card => {
  // 2C or led suit cards or not:H or whatever
  return this.choice(card, plays, () => {
    card.move('played.mine');
    return this.endTurn();




moves are:
  movex [el1, el2, el3]
  movey [el1, el2] [space1, space2]
  movez no-args
  moven number

sends: {
  movex: choices: [$el1, $el2, $el3], prompt: 'Move X'
  movey: choices: [$el1, $el2], prompt: 'Move Y'
  movez: prompt: 'Move Z',
}

appears as:
  el1 -> ctx-menu [Move X, Move Y] -> [space1, space2]
  el3 click
  'Move Z' button

2nd send: {
  movey: args:[$el1], choices: [$space1, $space2], prompt: 'Move Y into space'
}

appears as:
  'move Y into space' with $space1, $space2 hilited
  'cancel' (removes the action, re-requests starting data from server)





confirmation step required per move? just add additional arg, chooseAndConfirm() ? acceptable round-trip for this?

drag(pieces, space, prompt, (piece => fn))

function flip(card) {
  return game.choose(card, game.board.findAll('card'), "Flip", () => {
    card.set('flipped', !card.get('flipped'))
  })
}

const flip = game.simpleAction(
  "Do Something",
  () => do something,
)

const flip = game.pieceAction(
  "Flip",
  game.board.findAll('card'),
  card => card.set('flipped', !card.get('flipped')),
)

const flip = game.dragAction(
  "Flip",
  game.board.findAll('card'),
  space,
  card => card.set('flipped', !card.get('flipped')),
)

actions: {
  flip: chooseAction(choices, label, choice => action),
  play: chooseAction(choices, label, chooseAction(choices2, label, (choice, choice2) => action)),
}


createActions({
  flip: {
    prompt: 'Flip me!',
    select: 'card',
    action: card => toggle
  },
  takeCoins: {
    prompt: 'Take how many',
    drag: 'card',
    onto: 'tableau'
  },
  play: {
    prompt: 'Play this card',
    promptOnto: 'To which tableau',
    drag: 'card',
    onto: 'tableau'
  },
  pass: {
    prompt: 'Pass 3 card',
    select: 'card',
    number: 3
    move: 'pass#mine',
  },
  endTurn: {
    prompt: 'End turn',
  },
  spend: {
    select: 'card',
    prompt: 'Spend on a card',
    next: {
      select: 'resource'
      prompt: 'Which resource',
      action: (card, piece) => {card.move(piece)}
    }
  }
])


    client holds action, args... as it builds
    server responds with follow-up choices

    
chooseAction(cs, f(c -> ?)) -> f(c -> t/f/a)

chooseAction(cs, chooseAction


how specify allowed moves
- allowedMoveElements (within parent)
- dragAction appends another selector
- draggableSpaces(el)

spaces have drag properties (free-move, arrangeable, sorted)
dragging into a free-move has to record relative xy! tricky, come back to this?
