# Boardzilla

Boardzilla is a framework for making and playing board games.

Using javascript to describe the game board and pieces, and then a simple set of rules to define what pieces can be moved by whom and at
what point. Boardzilla comes with a built-in web app that can used to play the game rules for any number of players, on web or mobile. Out
of the box it translates the rules of the game into a simple set of draggable objects, and these can be customized to your heart's content
with CSS and images.
